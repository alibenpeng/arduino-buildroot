This is an Arduino build system which is based on the Makefile by edam, which can be downloaded here:

http://ed.am/dev/make/arduino-mk

To use it just copy the template folder and rename template.pde to the name of your new folder.
If you are using anything other than an Arduino UNO, also change the BOARD line in the Makefile.
